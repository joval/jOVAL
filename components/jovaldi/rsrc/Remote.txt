NOTES ON USING THE REMOTE PLUGIN TO SCAN WINDOWS MACHINES

By default, Windows is configured to disallow remote administration.  However,
in order to scan your machine without the overhead of deploying an agent, jOVAL
must use the built-in remote management features of the Windows operating
system.

The simplest way to configure your Windows environment to enable remote access
is to enable the following rule in Group Policy:

   "Windows Firewall: Allow remote administration exception"

If you are not using Group Policy to manage your Windows machines, it is
possible to enable remote administration individually on each machine by
following these steps:

1) Open a command prompt (Start->Run->cmd.exe).  On Windows Vista and Windows 7,
   you must right-click and select the "Run As Administrator" option.

2) Configure the Remote registry service to auto-start (and start it) by
   entering the following commands at the command prompt:

   sc config RemoteRegistry start= auto
   sc start RemoteRegistry

3) Configure the Windows Firewall to permit RPC and DCOM traffic by entering
   the following commands:

   netsh firewall set service RemoteAdmin enable
   netsh firewall add portopening protocol=tcp port=135 name=DCOM_TCP135
   netsh firewall add allowedprogram program=%windir%\system32\wbem\unsecapp.exe name=WMI
   netsh firewall add allowedprogram program=%windir%\system32\dllhost.exe name=Dllhost

You should now be able to scan your Windows machine remotely using jOVAL!

To verify if the Windows Firewall policies are set correctly on a machine, you
can enter the following command from a prompt:

   netsh firewall show state

The output should resemble the following:

   Firewall status:
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Profile                           = [Domain or Standard]
   Operational mode                  = Enable
   Exception mode                    = Enable
   Multicast/broadcast response mode = Enable
   Notification mode                 = Enable
   Group policy version              = Windows Firewall
   Remote admin mode                 = Enable


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DETAILS ABOUT REQUIRED CONNECTIVITY

Your network administrator may want to write custom firewall rules to
accommodate remote scanning.  The following describes the interactions that are
required for successful DCOM communication.

DCOM uses a TCP connection to the RPC service (RpcSs) on port 135.  The RPC
service is hosted in the process:
   %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe

DCOM calls may require asynchronous inbound redirection using TCP to COM
components hosted inside one of the following processes: 
   %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem\unsecapp.exe
   %SystemRoot%\system32\dllhost.exe

In the case of WMI, traffic may be redirected to the WMI service (Winmgmt) on
any port via TCP.  The WMI service is hosted in the process:
   %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe

Asynchronous redirection can occur on any port (typically above port 5000).
However, it is possible to restrict the ports used for RPC for the purpose of
managing the traffic through firewalls.  See the following KB article:
