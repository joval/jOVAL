Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL®) License

Your use of OVAL is conditioned upon acceptance of the following terms and conditions:

OVAL is comprised of the OVAL Language, OVAL Content, and the OVAL Repository each is defined below:

    The OVAL Language serves as the framework and vocabulary of OVAL. The Language covers the three steps of the assessment process: an OVAL System Characteristics schema for representing system information, an OVAL Definition schema for expressing a specific machine state, and an OVAL Results schema for reporting the results of an assessment.
    OVAL Content is content written in the OVAL Language. All content written in the OVAL Language is considered OVAL Content.
    The OVAL Repository is a collection of OVAL Content hosted by The MITRE Corporation. It is the central meeting place for the OVAL Community to discuss, analyze, store, and disseminate OVAL Definitions. Each definition in the OVAL Repository determines whether a specified software vulnerability, configuration issue, program, or patch is present on a system.
