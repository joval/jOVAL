NOTES ON USING THE REMOTE PLUGIN TO SCAN WINDOWS MACHINES

Windows 7 ships with remote management completely disabled. To scan Windows 7 machines, follow these steps:

First, you must start the Remote Registry service:
  Control Panel->System and Security->Administrative Tools->Services

Second, you must enable remote administration:
  1. Start cmd.exe as Administrator
  2. Run the command: winrm qc

Alternatively:
  1. Start Powershell as Administrator
  2. Run the commandlet: Enable-PSRemoting

Next, the Windows Firewall must be configured in order to allow remote access to COM servers.  The following article
explains how this is accomplished:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa822854%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

These are, more or less, the rules you'll need to allow incoming connections to arbitrary DCOM servers:
  netsh advfirewall firewall add rule dir=in name="DCOM" service=rpcss action=allow protocol=TCP localport=135
  netsh advfirewall firewall add rule dir=in name ="UnsecApp" [remoteip=<range>] action=allow

Since access to WMI is specifically required, the following utility can be helpful in debugging problems with remote WMI access:

At this point, you will be able to browse a remote registry.  In order to use DCOM components like WMI, you will need to be
able to register them remotely.  This requires you to have permission to do so, which in some cases /MAY/ require you to change
ownership of the relevant registry class from the TrustedInstaller to the Administrators group:
  1. Launch 'regedit.exe' as 'Administrator'
  2. Find the following registry key: 'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{76A64158-CB41-11D1-8B02-00600806D9B6}'
  3. Right click and select 'Permissions'
  4. Click the 'Advanced' button.
  5. Select the tab labeled 'Owner'
  6. Add the user you want to allow to connect to the owners list
  7. Click the 'Ok' button.
  8. Now highlight the user and grant Full Control
  9. Click 'Ok'
